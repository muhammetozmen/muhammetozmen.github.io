# Welcome to My Network

You have reached the personal data node of **Muhammet Özmen**.
This site is currently under construction but it's not unfinished, so you can wander around as you want. Please mind the dust.

## Purpose of Statement

This platform serves as a repository for my experiments in software engineering, digital entertainment analysis, and general daily life things. Use the navigation on the left to wander the site.

* **Home** is here for you to use if you get homesick, home sweet home.
* **Blogs** is for my writings. I love to speak, and when I don't, I love to write. I write about interesting aspects of Technology in **Tech**, my project information in **devlogs**, and all other stuff in **Journal**.
* I love to draw, both digital and traditional, and I will put my art collection in **Gallery**. Can't promise it's going to be well organized.
* **Projects** are my daily projects. I share their links, videos, or related devlogs there.
* **About Me** is about you. Just kidding, it's about me. You can find very private information about me there.

### System Updates
* **2026-01-28**: The site have been created and pushed.
